            Peter Pan first appeared as a character in Barrie's
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_White_Bird">The Little White Bird</a>
            (1902), a
            novel for adults. In chapters 13–18, titled "Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens", Peter is
            a seven-day-old baby and has flown from his nursery to
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kensington_Gardens">Kensington Gardens</a> in
            London,
            where the fairies and birds taught him to fly. He is described as "betwixt-and-between"
            a boy and a bird. Barrie returned to the character of Peter Pan, putting him at the
            centre of his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stage_play">stage play</a> titled
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Wendy">
                Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up</a>, which
            premiered on 27 December 1904 at the
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duke_of_York%27s_Theatre">
                Duke of York's Theatre</a> in London.
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>
            Following the success of the 1904 play, Barrie's publishers,
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hodder_and_Stoughton">Hodder and Stoughton</a>,
            extracted the Peter
            Pan chapters of The Little White Bird and published them in 1906 under the title
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan_in_Kensington_Gardens">Peter
                Pan in Kensington Gardens</a>, with the addition of illustrations by

            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Pan#cite_note-4"><sup>[4]</sup></a>
            Barrie later adapted and expanded the 1904 play's storyline as a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Novel">novel</a>, which was
            published in 1911 as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_and_Wendy">Peter and

            J. M. Barrie may have based the character of Peter Pan on his older brother, David, who
            died in an ice-skating accident the day before his 14th birthday. His mother and brother
            thought of him as forever a boy.<a
